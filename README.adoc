= Memorized Question Answering System

This is a System that used memorized queries to simulate a question answering system.

## Configuration
Before you can start the system you have to configure the following properties in the application.properties file.

### Tripestore

```
qado.resultset.maxrows=10000
```
* qado.resultset.maxrows: The maximum number of rows that the system will return. If the database can only
handle less than 10.000 rows you should change this value.

#### Stardog
```
stardog.url=
stardog.database=
stardog.username=
stardog.password=
```
* stardog.url: The url of the triplestore. For example: http://localhost:7200
* stardog.database: The name of the database in the triplestore. For example: qado
* stardog.username: The username of the triplestore. For example: admin
* stardog.password: The password of the triplestore. For example: admin

#### Virtuoso
```
virtuoso.url=
virtuoso.graph=
virtuoso.username=
virtuoso.password=
```
* virtuoso.url: The url of the triplestore. For example: http://localhost:7200
* virtuoso.graph: The name of the graph in the triplestore. For example: urn:bulkload:general
* virtuoso.username: The username of the triplestore. For example: admin
* virtuoso.password: The password of the triplestore. For example: admin

### more options
You can change the following properties in the application.properties file if necessary.
```
qado.question.knowledgebase=wikidata
qado.question.user=open
```
* qado.question.knowledgebase: The knowledgebase that is used to answer the questions. For example: wikidata
* qado.question.user: The user that is used to answer the questions. For example: open

## How to ask a question
You can ask a question by sending a POST request to the following url: `{server}/mem-qa-system`.
The body of the request should contain a JSON object with the following properties:

* question: (required) The question that you want to ask. It musst be a question in the QADO dataset.
* language: (required) The language of the question. It musst be a language in the QADO dataset
* number_of_results_items: The number of results that you want to receive. If this field is 0 or not in the request the
system will return all results.
* dataset: The dataset that you want to use. It musst be a dataset in the QADO database. If this field is not in the
request the system will use datasets.

BE CAREFUL: If you send a request without `number_of_results_items` and `dataset` (<<Minimum Example>>) the system will
respond with all possible results. This can take a very long time.

### Full example
```
{
    "question": "What is the revenue of IBM?",
    "language": "en",
    "number_of_results_items": 5,
    "dataset": "QALD-9-plus-test-wikidata"
}
```

### Minimum Example
```
{
    "question": "What is the revenue of IBM?",
    "language": "en"
}
```

### Example without dataset
```
{
    "question": "What is the revenue of IBM?",
    "language": "en",
    "number_of_results_items": 5
}
```

### Example without number of results items
```
{
    "question": "What is the revenue of IBM?",
    "language": "en",
    "dataset": "QALD-9-plus-test-wikidata"
}
```

## Swagger UI
The system has a Swagger UI. You can use it to test the system and to see the documentation of the endpoints.
The Swagger UI is available at the following url: `{server}/swagger-ui/index.html`
